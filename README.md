What is GoodFilms?
-----------
GoodFilms.io (v 1.0.0) is the latest app for videophiles. It allows them to track
films they want to watch, films they've already seen, rate and review movies, and
discover new things to add to their want-to-watch list.

Technologies
------------
We used AngularJS as our front-end framework, Express/NodeJS for
server-side development, and MongoDB for our database. We also used
the jQuery, angular-route, lodash, Bootstrap, Bluebird, and Mongoose libraries
& technologies and the OMDb and the MovieDB API's to source our movie posters
and information.

For authentication, we used bcrypt-nodejs and express-session from npm.

Installation and Use
--------------------
To run this repo locally, clone it to your desired file and cd into it. In the
terminal, run `npm install`. In a new terminal tab, run the command `mongo` from
the command line and in another new tab, run `npm start` to start the server.

Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser of choice to use the app. We hope you enjoy
searching and reviewing your favorite movies!
